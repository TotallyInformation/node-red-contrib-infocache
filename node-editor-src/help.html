<p>
    A general-purpose caching node that saves/replays messages.
    Is able to use <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-uibuilder" taget="_blank">uibuilder's</a> cache control messages but is fine to use without uibuilder.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        The whole msg will be stored in the cache.
        However, several properties will be removed before storage:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>res and req<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>
            The <code>res</code> (result) and <code>req</code> (request) properties are created by the ExpressJS web server build-in to Node-RED.
            They are extremely large and recursive which means that they cannot be serialised in order to save them.
        </dd>
        <dt>_auth &amp; _uibAuth<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Authorisation and authentication info. May be sensitive so removed from store.
            Will be added from the control msg (from the client) when a replay is requested.
        </dd>
    </dl>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Standard input messages are passed through without change to the output.
    </p>
    <p>
        uibuilder control messages are not passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a cache replay control request, the requested cache entries are replayed in the requested order (FIFO by default).
        Replayed messages are not quite exact copies of the original message, see above for the differences.
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload<span class="property-type">string | buffer</span></dt>
        <dd></dd>
    </dl>
